Quantitative models for Economics in MATLAB

  ps1: Matrix operations, Loops, Functions & matrices, Nesting
  
  ps3: 
  
    a. compare L-U decomposition to Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel
    
    b. using tic toc to compare the time to solve the system with different methods
    
    c. estimate the demand elasticity using MATLAB
    
  ps4: Production and labor supply,  using a function iteration method,  bisection, and fsolve to solve variables and find which is faster.

  ps5: 
  
    a. Computing the change in consumer surplus
    
    b. solving numerically for alpha in a non-linear equation that involves an integral
    
    c. a market of an agricultural commodity with production risk and government subsidy
